shuffle-kit is a personal hobby project. However, I'm happy to accept contributions from others. 

1. First clone the repository to a location of your choice 
```
git clone https://github.com/jmssnr/shuffle-kit.git
```

2. Run `poetry install` to create a new virtual environment and install all dependencies, including dependencies for development and the documentation

3. Run the tests to ensure everything is working properly
```
pytest
```
